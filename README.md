# InfoSysTaskType


### Overview

This directory contains the data collection and analysis material for the Information Systems paper entitled "On the Cognitive and Behavioral Effects of Abstraction and Fragmentation in Modularized Process Models".

Structure

* Folder [analysis](https://github.com/promilab/InfoSysTaskType/tree/main/analysis "analysis"): contains the Python notebooks used to compute the comprehension, cognitive load, search and inference phases, process maps and time series.
    * Notebook1_Comprehension-and-subjectCLmeasure.ipynb: Computes the comprehension and the subjective perceived difficulty measure.
    * Notebook2_Fixation-based-measures.ipynb: Computes all cognitive load and behavioral measures based on fixations.
    * Notebook3_LHIPA-pupil-measure.ipynb: Computes the LHIPA pupul-related measure.
    * Notebook4_Search-and-inference-in-local-global.ipynb: Computes measures based on search and inference phases.
    * Notbook5_Entropy-and-qulitAnalysis.ipynb: Computes the entropy measures based on search and inference phases + time series and process maps.

* Folder [figures](https://github.com/promilab/InfoSysTaskType/tree/main/figures "figures"): contains the figures used in the paper in a larger resolution.

* Folder [material](https://github.com/promilab/InfoSysTaskType/tree/main/material "material"): contains the material used for the data collection.
